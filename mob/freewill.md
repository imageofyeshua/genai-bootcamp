What is free-will?
Free will is the capacity of rational beings (humans, and in some theological views, angels) to make genuinely free choices that are not wholly determined by external forces (like fate, divine coercion, or physical laws). It’s a foundational concept in philosophy, theology, and ethics, with profound implications for morality, responsibility, and divine justice. Here’s a breakdown:

1. Core Definition
   Free will means the ability to:

Choose between alternatives (e.g., good vs. evil).

Act voluntarily, not under compulsion.

Be morally accountable for those choices (blame/praise is meaningful).

2. Biblical Basis for Free Will
   Humanity’s Creation:

"Let us make man in our image" (Gen. 1:26) → Includes the capacity to choose.

Adam and Eve’s choice to disobey (Gen. 3) presupposes genuine freedom.

Moral Commands:

"Choose this day whom you will serve" (Josh. 24:15).

"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life" (Rev. 22:17, KJV).

Divine Appeals:

God’s pleas for repentance (Ezek. 18:30–32) imply the ability to respond.

3. Theological Debates
   A. Libertarian Free Will
   View: Choices are uncaused by prior conditions (including God’s foreknowledge).

Supporters: Arminians, Eastern Orthodox, most Catholics.

Key Verse: "If you are willing and obedient..." (Isa. 1:19).

B. Compatibilist Free Will
View: Freedom is acting according to one’s nature, even if determined (e.g., by God’s sovereignty).

Supporters: Calvinists, Reformed theologians.

Key Verse: "Work out your salvation... for it is God who works in you" (Phil. 2:12–13).

C. Hard Determinism
View: No free will; all choices are caused by prior events (e.g., naturalism).

Critique: Rejected by most Christians as incompatible with biblical morality.

4. Why Free Will Matters
   The Problem of Evil: If God is good, why does evil exist?

Answer: Evil stems from misuse of free will (Augustine’s "privatio boni").

Divine Justice: Punishment/reward presuppose responsibility (Rom. 2:6–8).

Love’s Necessity: Love cannot be coerced (e.g., God desires voluntary worship, John 4:23).

5. Objections & Responses
   Predestination vs. Free Will:

Calvinism: God elects some to salvation (Eph. 1:4–5).

Arminianism: Election is based on foreknown faith (Rom. 8:29).

Omniscience Paradox:

If God knows future choices, are they truly free?

Resolution: God’s timeless knowledge doesn’t cause choices (Boethius’ "eternal now").

6. Practical Implications
   Ethics: Without free will, moral responsibility collapses.

Prayer: Intercession assumes choices can be influenced (1 Tim. 2:1–4).

Evangelism: Appeals to repentance (Acts 17:30) imply ability to respond.

C.S. Lewis: "Free will, though it makes evil possible, is the only thing that makes love possible."
