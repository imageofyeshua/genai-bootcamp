Question: What is the origin of sin?

The Origin of Sin
Sin did not originate with humanity but entered creation through the rebellion of a glorious angelic being—Lucifer (Satan)—before the fall of Adam and Eve. Here’s the biblical explanation:

1. Lucifer’s Rebellion (Ezekiel 28:12–17; Isaiah 14:12–14)
   Lucifer’s Identity:

A high-ranking "anointed cherub" (Ezekiel 28:14), created perfect and beautiful.

Called "Morning Star" (Latin: Lucifer) in Isaiah 14:12.

The Root of His Fall: Pride (1 Timothy 3:6).

He declared:

"I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God… I will make myself like the Most High" (Isaiah 14:13–14).

This was the first sin—a creature rejecting God’s authority to seek self-worship.

Judgment:

Cast out of heaven (Luke 10:18; Revelation 12:9).

Became Satan ("adversary") and the father of lies (John 8:44).

2. The Fall of Humanity (Genesis 3)
   Satan’s Temptation:

Deceived Eve by twisting God’s words (Genesis 3:1–5).

Promised, "You will be like God"—echoing his own pride.

Adam & Eve’s Sin:

Chose disobedience (eating the forbidden fruit).

Consequences:

Spiritual death (separation from God, Genesis 3:8–10).

Physical death entered the world (Genesis 3:19; Romans 5:12).

Creation was cursed (Genesis 3:17–18).

3. Why Did God Allow Sin?
   Free Will: Love requires the freedom to choose (God did not create robots).

Greater Purpose:

To display His mercy, justice, and glory in redemption (Ephesians 2:7).

Christ’s victory over sin is greater than Adam’s fall (Romans 5:20–21).

4. Key Takeaways
   Sin began with Satan’s pride and spread through human rebellion.

All creation was corrupted (Romans 8:20–22).

God’s plan to defeat sin was already in motion (Genesis 3:15; Revelation 20:10).

"Where sin increased, grace increased all the more" (Romans 5:20).
