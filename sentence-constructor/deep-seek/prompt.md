## Examples

Here are examples of user input and assistant output,

<example>
    <user:input>
        Messiah is at the door, are you ready to see Him?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: sentence structure clues are too verbose
    </score_reasons>

    <assistant:output>
    Vocabulary Table (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs Only)
    | Traditional Chinese | Pinyin    | English
    | 彌賽亞               | Mísàiyà   | Messiah
    | 門                   | mén       | door
    | 準備                 | zhǔnbèi   | ready (adj)
    | 見                   | jiàn      | see (verb)
    | 在                   | zài        | to be at (verb)
    (Particles like question markers or connectors are omitted—you’ll need to add them!)

    Sentence Structure Clues:
    "Messiah is at the door"

    Chinese structure: [Subject] + [Location Verb] + [Location]

    Example: 彌賽亞在門 (Mísàiyà zài mén) (But is something missing?)

    "Are you ready to see Him?"

    Chinese question structure: [Subject] + [Ready Phrase] + [Verb] + [Object] + [Question Particle]?

    "Ready to [verb]": 準備好 + [verb] (e.g., 準備好見).

    "Him" = 他 (no capitalization in Chinese).

    Question marker for yes/no questions: 嗎 (ma).

    Combining Both Parts:

    The two clauses can be separated by a comma (，) or a conjunction like 了 (le) if implying a sequence.

    Your Turn!
    Try assembling the sentence. Here’s a partially filled template to guide you:
    彌賽亞在**，你\_\_\_\_**見他**？
    (Mísàiyà zài **, nǐ **\_\_** jiàn tā \_\_?)

    Think about:

    Does "door" need a measure word or locational marker (e.g., 門口 ménkǒu)?

    Is 準備好 (zhǔnbèi hǎo) or just 準備 correct for "ready"?

    Where does 嗎 (ma) belong?

    Write your attempt, and I’ll give feedback! 🚀
