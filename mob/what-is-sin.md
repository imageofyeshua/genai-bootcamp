Question: What Is Sin?

Sin is any thought, word, or action that violates God’s moral law (1 John 3:4) and breaks relationship with Him. It is not just a mistake or social taboo but a rebellion against the Creator’s holiness.

1. Biblical Definitions of Sin
   "Missing the Mark" (Hamartia, ἁμαρτία): Falling short of God’s perfect standard (Romans 3:23).

"Lawlessness" (Anomia, ἀνομία): Willful disobedience to God’s commands (1 John 3:4).

"Transgression" (Pesha, פֶּשַׁע): Crossing a known boundary (James 2:9–11).

"Iniquity" (Avon, עָוֹן): Moral corruption or twistedness (Isaiah 53:5).

2. The Origin of Sin
   Lucifer’s Pride → First sin in the universe (Isaiah 14:12–14; Ezekiel 28:15–17).

Adam & Eve’s Disobedience → Brought sin into humanity (Genesis 3; Romans 5:12).

3. Two Types of Sin
   A. Original Sin (Inherited Corruption)
   All humans are born with a sinful nature (Psalm 51:5; Romans 5:19).

Results in spiritual death (separation from God, Ephesians 2:1).

B. Actual Sin (Personal Choices)
Sins of Commission (Doing what God forbids, e.g., lying, stealing).

Sins of Omission (Failing to do what God commands, James 4:17).

Heart Sins (Unseen motives—lust, hatred, pride, Matthew 5:28; 1 John 3:15).

4. The Consequences of Sin
   Spiritual Death (Genesis 2:17; Romans 6:23).

Broken Relationships (With God, others, and creation, Isaiah 59:2).

Eternal Judgment (Revelation 20:14–15) unless forgiven through Christ.

5. The Only Remedy for Sin
   Jesus’ Sacrifice: "He bore our sins in His body on the cross" (1 Peter 2:24).

Repentance & Faith: Turning from sin and trusting Christ (Acts 3:19; Romans 10:9).

Sanctification: The Holy Spirit’s work to free us from sin’s power (Romans 8:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:23).

6. Key Verses on Sin
   "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ" (Romans 6:23).

"If we confess our sins, He is faithful to forgive us" (1 John 1:9).

"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man. God will provide a way out" (1 Corinthians 10:13).

7. A Warning & Hope
   "Whoever practices sin is of the devil" (1 John 3:8).

"In Him [Jesus] we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins" (Ephesians 1:7).

Sin is universal but not unbeatable—Christ’s victory offers freedom (John 8:36). Would you like to explore how to overcome a specific sin struggle?
