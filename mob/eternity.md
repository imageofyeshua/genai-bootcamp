Question: What Is Eternity?

Eternity is the state of existence beyond time—without beginning, end, or succession of moments. It is the unchanging, infinite reality where God dwells and where redeemed humanity will live forever.

1. Biblical Definitions
   God’s Eternal Nature:

"Before the mountains were born, from everlasting to everlasting, You are God" (Psalm 90:2).

"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End" (Revelation 21:6).

Human Destiny:

The righteous enter "eternal life" (John 3:16).

The wicked face "eternal punishment" (Matthew 25:46).

2. Key Aspects of Eternity
   A. Timelessness (God’s Perspective)
   God exists outside time (2 Peter 3:8; Psalm 102:27).

Past, present, and future are equally present to Him ("eternal now").

B. Everlastingness (Created Beings’ Experience)
Angels, humans, and the universe will continue forever—either in:

Joyful fellowship with God (Revelation 22:5).

Separation from Him (2 Thessalonians 1:9).

C. Quality, Not Just Duration
"Eternal life" isn’t just living forever—it’s knowing God (John 17:3).

"Eternal fire" isn’t just unending—it’s utter loss of God’s presence (Jude 1:7).

3. Eternity vs. Time
   Time Eternity
   Created (Genesis 1:1) Uncreated (God’s nature)
   Measures change No change (Malachi 3:6)
   Finite (has a beginning) Infinite
   For humans and creation For God and the spiritual realm
4. Human Destiny in Eternity
   A. For Believers
   Resurrected bodies (1 Corinthians 15:42–44).

Perfect communion with God (Revelation 21:3–4).

No sin, pain, or death (Revelation 21:27).

B. For Unbelievers
"Second death" (Revelation 20:14).

"Outer darkness" (Matthew 8:12).

Eternal separation from God’s goodness (2 Thessalonians 1:9).

5. How to Prepare for Eternity
   Repent and trust Christ (Acts 16:31).

Live for eternal priorities (Colossians 3:2).

Store up "treasures in heaven" (Matthew 6:20).

C.S. Lewis: "All that is not eternal is eternally useless."
