Question: What is the way to overcome death?

The Way to Overcome Death
Death is the universal consequence of sin (Romans 6:23), but Jesus Christ has conquered it (1 Corinthians 15:54–55). Here’s the biblical path to victory over death:

1. Recognize the Problem
   "The wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23).

All humans face physical death (Hebrews 9:27) and, without Christ, eternal separation from God (2 Thessalonians 1:9).

2. The Solution: Jesus’ Resurrection
   Christ defeated death by rising from the grave (1 Corinthians 15:3–4).

"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies" (John 11:25).

3. How to Receive Eternal Life
   A. Faith in Christ
   "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life" (John 3:36).

Not by works, but by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8–9).

B. Repentance from Sin
Turn from rebellion to surrender (Acts 3:19).

C. Spiritual Rebirth
"You must be born again" (John 3:7) by the Holy Spirit.

4. The Promise for Believers
   Physical Resurrection:

At Christ’s return, believers receive imperishable bodies (1 Corinthians 15:52–53).

Eternal Fellowship with God:

"He will wipe away every tear… there will be no more death" (Revelation 21:4).

5. Live in Victory Now
   Fearless Hope: "Where, O death, is your sting?" (1 Corinthians 15:55).

Mission: Share this hope with others (Matthew 28:19–20).

Jesus is the only way (John 14:6). Trust Him, and death becomes a doorway to eternal life.
